Getting good at PCB
Objectives: Design a PCB with an RP2040 which includes ICs to read 9-axis of sensor data (yaw, pitch, roll, acceleration, gyro, etc)m barometric pressure and temperature.

Design requirements:
- USB-C must be included. Pay attention to VBUS as thatâ€™s your power input
- RP2040
- 9-axis measurement
- Pressure sensing
- Temperature sensing
- LCSC/JLC part # included for all symbols used (i.e C2040)
- Bonus points for readable schematics and compact layout!!!!
